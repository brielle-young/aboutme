      <h1>Hi, I'm Brielle.</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a Biometry & Statistics student at Cornell University, pursuing minors in Computer Science and Infectious Disease Biology. I'm interested in how diseases evolve and spread under real-world pressures, like vaccination, climate change, and environmental disruption, and how we can use data to better understand and respond to those dynamics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm doing computational research on immune system dynamics under different vaccine regimes and environmental conditions, with a focus on pathogen evolution and disease risk. I'm especially drawn to questions at the intersection of public health, agriculture, and the environment, where small biological changes can have massive downstream impacts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of research, I care a lot about sustainability and policy. I'm motivated by work that can make a signifcant impact on communities, whether that's to improve public health decisions, anticipate disease risk, or support more resilient environmental systems. I am also an avid reader and landscape oil painter.
      </p>

      <p> 
        After graduation, I hope to pursue graduate studies in computational biology.
      </p>
