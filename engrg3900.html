        <h2>Learning to Lead With Clarity, Care, and Consequence</h2>
        <p>
          Through Cornell’s Selander Center Engineering Leadership certification program, I’ve spent the past
          months doing the less visible work of leadership: understanding how I think under pressure, how I
          collaborate across disciplines, and how my values show up (or fail to) in moments that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I’ve learned most clearly is this: I lead best when I’m building something <em>with</em> others—
          especially when the problem is complex, messy, and human.
        </p>

        <h2>Who I Am as a Leader</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a systems thinker by nature. I’m energized by big-picture problems, but I care deeply about the details
          that make solutions usable and fair. I value integrity, curiosity, and accountability, and I try to bring
          those into every team and project I’m part of.
        </p>

            <h3>I’m most effective when I…</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Create clarity in ambiguous situations</li>
              <li>Translate complex ideas across disciplines</li>
              <li>Make space for quieter voices in group settings</li>
              <li>Balance urgency with thoughtfulness</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Delegating more fully</li>
              <li>Letting progress matter more than perfection</li>
              <li>Trusting others with ownership, not just execution</li>

      <h2>Collaborative Leadership in Action</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Project: Empowering Communities Through Accessible Sustainability Knowledge</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        <p>
          Many sustainability programs already exist—but people don’t know about them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Across the United States, states and cities offer hundreds of sustainability-related initiatives, from renewable
        energy incentives to water conservation rebates. Yet the information is often fragmented, hard to locate, and
        inconsistently communicated across agencies. Low public awareness—not lack of incentives—is one of the biggest
        barriers to participation (Carley &amp; Konisky, 2020).
      </p>

      <h3>Our response has two parts:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>A centralized, public-facing website</strong> that compiles, verifies, and clearly explains sustainability
          programs for all 50 states and U.S. territories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A community outreach strategy</strong>—partnerships with nonprofits, universities, community organizations,
          and specialists—paired with social media and press engagement to drive awareness and adoption.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        My leadership focus has been on alignment: aligning technical development with human behavior, aligning accuracy
        with accessibility, and aligning team roles with individual strengths.

        <h2>What This Experience Changed for Me</h2>
        <p>
          ENGRG 3900 reframed how I think about impact. I’ve learned that leadership isn’t about having the best idea—
          it’s about creating the conditions for good ideas to survive, scale, and serve real people.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience strengthened my belief that technical work carries ethical weight, and that leadership means
          taking responsibility for how systems affect communities—especially those historically excluded from decision-making.

        <h2>How I Want to Show Up Going Forward</h2>
        <p>
          As I move forward in research, policy, and public health–focused work, I’m carrying this with me:
        </p>

        <ul class="values">
          <li><strong>Lead with humility</strong> — listen first, assume less.</li>
          <li><strong>Design with intention</strong> — build for the real constraints people face.</li>
          <li><strong>Build for inclusion</strong> — especially for those most often left out of the room.</li>
        </ul>
