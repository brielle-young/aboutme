    <h1>Engineering Leadership Certification Program</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      ENGRG 3900 made me rethink how I lead in a very real way. Before this class, I thought leadership was mostly about being capable and getting things done. This semester showed me that it’s also about how you move through a group, the impact you have on others, what you prioritize, and whether the systems you build actually help people.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      I’m not the loudest person in the room. I lead by listening first and acting deliberately by paying attention to people and really taking the time to understand what's happening before moving forward. In ENGRG 3900, I connected strongly with the leadership type Grace, which emphasizes thoughtfulness and steadiness. I notice how that approach guides how I work on complex, people-centered problems in sustainability, environmental systems, and public health.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I appreciated about this course is that it didn’t stop at reflection. We spent time thinking about our values and strengths, but then we had to act on them in teams where things didn’t always go smoothly (we changed our project idea signficantly!). Leadership started to feel like responsibility by making choices on purpose and understanding the importance of alignment (with values, purpose, and in collaboration).

      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <p>
        The values that show up most in how I lead are perseverance, dedication, authenticity, passion, and community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perseverance and dedication matter to me because a lot of the work I care about is slow. Research takes time. Systems change takes time. I’m okay with that, as long as the work is moving toward something meaningful. Passion keeps me engaged when things get hard or repetitive (I don’t do well when I don’t care about the “why").
      </p>
      <p>
        Community is the value that grounds everything else. I don’t think impact is about big statements or abstract outcomes. It’s about whether someone can actually use what you built, understand what you shared, or feel supported by the system instead of confused by it.

      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        My top strengths are Belief, Analytical, Learner, Relator, and Individualization, and I see them show up together in how I work with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Belief is what makes me commit fully when something aligns with my values. If I care about the purpose, I’ll show up consistently and follow through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytical helps me break things down and think through tradeoffs instead of rushing decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learner shows up in how I handle things I don’t know yet. I’m curious, I ask questions, and I’m willing to sit with confusion until it clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relator means I care about trust and real connection on teams, not just surface-level collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individualization helps me notice how different people work best and adjust instead of expecting everyone to think the same way I do.
      </p>
      <p>These strengths shape how I contribute to teams: I bring structure, ask hard questions, and try to make sure people feel heard and supported at the same time.</p>

      <h2>Leadership in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Through this reflection, my team and I (The Systemizers) identified a project that aligned with our collective values, strenths, and purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">Project: Empowering Communities Through Accessible Sustainability Knowledge</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        <p>Many sustainability programs already exist, but people don’t know about them.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Across the United States, states and cities offer hundreds of sustainability-related initiatives, from renewable
        energy incentives to water conservation rebates. Yet the information is often fragmented, hard to locate, and
        inconsistently communicated across agencies. Low public awareness, not lack of incentives, is one of the biggest
        barriers to participation.
      </p>

      <p class="list-intro"><strong>Our response has two parts:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>A centralized, public-facing website</strong> that compiles, verifies, and clearly explains sustainability
          programs for all 50 states and U.S. territories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A community outreach strategy</strong> - partnerships with nonprofits, universities, community organizations,
          and specialists - paired with social media and press engagement to drive awareness and adoption.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Understanding my values helped me stay focused on impact instead of perfection while working on this project. It reminded me that leadership isn’t about having all the answers, but about making thoughtful decisions that truly align with the vision and purpose we're working towards.

      <h2>Collaboration &amp; Communication</h2>
      <p>
        ENGRG 3900 also made me more aware of how I communicate when I’m in a leadership role.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve learned that setting expectations early saves a lot of frustration later. I’ve also learned that people need different kinds of clarity, some want structure and some want space to digest information before contributing. Paying attention to that makes collaboration smoother and more honest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best teams I’ve been on are the ones where there’s a shared sense of purpose and where people feel comfortable asking questions or pushing back. I try to help create that kind of environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose &amp; Direction</h2>
      <p>
       This course helped me put words to something I already felt: I want to work on problems where systems and real people intersect. I care about creating tools that actually make life easier or fairer for communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        ENGRG 3900 didn’t change who I am as a leader, but it helped me understand myself better and lead more intentionally because of it. I’m excited to keep building on this in the next semester of the Engineering Leadership Certification Program.
