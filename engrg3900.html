    <h1>Engineering Leadership Certification Program</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      ENGRG 3900 clarified how I want to show up as a leader: grounded in my values, engaged, and focused on building systems that impact communities. I lead through listening, analysis, and alignment, bringing structure to complex problems while respecting the different strengths and perspectives within a team.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      My approach is shaped by perseverance and dedication, supported by analytical thinking and a strong sense of purpose. I'm motivated by work that turns research and technical findings into tools that benefit people, particularly in public health, sustainability, and environmental systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course helped me connect self-awareness with practice. We spent weeks reflecting and then acting in teams. Leadership, for me, has become a matter of alignment and responsibility through intentional decision-making.

      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <p>
        My leadership is grounded in perseverance, dedication, passion, and community. Perseverance and dedication shape how I approach long-term, difficult challenges, especially in research contexts where progress is incremental. Passion keeps me invested in work that matters, and community grounds how I define success. Impact is not abstract to me, but measured by how my work affects real people.

      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        My strongest leadership assets are Belief, Analytical, Learner, Relator, and Individualization.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Belief roots my decisions in purpose.</li>
        <li>Analytical allows me to break down complex systems and clarify tradeoffs.</li>
        <li>Relator supports trust-building within teams.</li>
        <li>Individualization helps me recognize and leverage the distinct strengths of collaborators.</li>
        <li>Learner drives continuous improvement and discovery of knowledge.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Together, these strengths shape how I contribute to teams, by aligning values, structure, and people.

      <h2>Leadership in Practice</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Project: Empowering Communities Through Accessible Sustainability Knowledge</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        <p>Many sustainability programs already exist, but people don’t know about them.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Across the United States, states and cities offer hundreds of sustainability-related initiatives, from renewable
        energy incentives to water conservation rebates. Yet the information is often fragmented, hard to locate, and
        inconsistently communicated across agencies. Low public awareness, not lack of incentives, is one of the biggest
        barriers to participation.
      </p>

      <p class="list-intro"><strong>Our response has two parts:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>A centralized, public-facing website</strong> that compiles, verifies, and clearly explains sustainability
          programs for all 50 states and U.S. territories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A community outreach strategy</strong> - partnerships with nonprofits, universities, community organizations,
          and specialists - paired with social media and press engagement to drive awareness and adoption.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Understanding my values and purpose has been instrumental in developing and collaborating on this project. I’ve noticed how leadership isn’t a static identity, but something practiced through deliberate action.

      <h2>Collaboration &amp; Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Through ENGRG 3900, I became more intentional about communication as a leadership tool, not just an interpersonal skill. I've learned the importance of setting shared expectations early, checking assumptions, and adjusting communication styles to fit different collaborators. I’ve found collaboration is strongest when there’s shared purpose and clear alignment.

      <h2>Purpose &amp; Direction</h2>
      <p>
        This course helped clarify my broader leadership purpose: to make meaningful change through research, tools, and systems that benefit communities. I'm motivated by work that translates technical findings into real-world impact, and I'm excited to keep developing this in the second semester of the Certification Program.
